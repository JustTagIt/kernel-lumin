ML Power Management SubSystem(PMSS) over MLMUX

Driver for ML proprietary PMSS communicating over MLMUX

Required properties:
 - compatible:		must be "ml,pmss_ml_mux".
 - ml,chan-name:	MLMUX client channel name.
 - mlmux:		phandle to the ML MUX controller.
 - extcon:		phandle to the extcon for controlling USB HOST stack state.

Optional properties:
 - vcomp_alert_irq: this property is used to create an interrupt which handles
				the case where VSYS drops below operating threshold.
 - #thermal-sensor-cells: 	when this property is set the thermal
 				frame work will be able to register the
 				node as a thermal sensor. It also enables
 				driver thermal fw sensor registration while
 				disabling power_supply thermal zone registration.
 - ml,batt_sens_id:
 - ml,chrg_sens_id: 	if we are using this node as thermal sensor then we can
 			optionally set these two variables to uniquely identify
 			battery id and charger id when registering with thermal
 			zone. If these options are not present and we are using
 			thermal sensor registration then batt id is 0 and chrg id
 			is 1.
 - ml,batt-hot-temp: 	if this property is set it will be used to signal
			to userspace that the battery is HOT and appropriate actions should be
			taken, e.g. start shutting down the system. The uevent will continuously
			be generated while in this state. If not set a DEFINE will be used instead.
			The unit is dC, i.e for 10.5C <105> should be used.
 - ml,batt-cold-temp: 	if this property is set it will be used to signal
			to userspace that the battery is COLD and appropriate actions should be
			taken, e.g. start shutting down the system. The uevent will continuously
			be generated while in this state. If not set a DEFINE will be used instead.
			The unit is dC, i.e for -10.5C <(-105)> should be used.
 - ml,batt-warm-temp: 	if this property is set it will be used to signal
			to userspace that the battery is WARM and appropriate actions should be
			taken, e.g. start shutting down the system. The uevent will continuously
			be generated while in this state. If not set only HOT state will be used.
			The unit is dC, i.e for 10.5C <105> should be used.
 - ml,batt-cool-temp: 	if this property is set it will be used to signal
			to userspace that the battery is COOL and appropriate actions should be
			taken, e.g. start shutting down the system. The uevent will be generated
			only on transition into this state. If not set only COLD state will be used.
			The unit is dC, i.e for -10.5C <(-105)> should be used.
 - bc12_cd:		phandle which points to device used for detecting BC1.2 ports. Used to get a
			reference to an extcon device that will notify us about BC1.2 port
			connection.
Example:
	ml_pmss {
		compatible = "ml,pmss_ml_mux";
		status = "okay";
		vcomp_alert_irq = <&tegra_aon_gpio TEGRA_AON_GPIO(S, 4) GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		ml,chan-name = "pmss";
		mlmux = <&ml_mux1>;
		extcon = <&host_extcon>;
		bc12_cd = <&usb_cd>;
		ml,batt_sens_id = <0>;
		ml,chrg_sens_id = <1>;
		ml,batt-hot-temp = <600>;
		ml,batt-cool-temp = <(-10)>;
		ml,batt-cold-temp = <(-50)>;
	};
