Kernel driver tmp108
====================

Supported chips:
  * Texas Instruments TMP108

Description
-----------

The Texas Instruments TMP108 temperature sensor implements one temperature
sensor.

The driver provides support to set the bits in the configuration register.

The device tree property "sensor-name" needs to be provided so multiple
TMP108 sensors can be supported.

The device tree property "skip-programming" can be used to skip programming
the configuration register.

The optional device tree property "temp-high" can be used to program the
high temperature register.

The optional device tree property "no-sleep" is used to keep the sensor in the
current mode and not put it in shutdown mode when the system goes to sleep.

The driver exposes sysfs-interface for temperatures: the temperature can
be read from "temp", T-HIGH from "temp_high", and T-LOW from "temp-low".

Example:
	tmp108_batt_sensor: tmp108@48 {
		compatible = "ti,tmp108";
		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x48>;
		skip-programming;
		sensor-name = "tmp108_batt";
		temp-high = <70000>;
	};
